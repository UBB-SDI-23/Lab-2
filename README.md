**Points**: 1

**Deadline**: Week 3

**Last chance deadline and penalties**: Week 5, -0.3 points / week delayed

----

Continue working on the application from the previous assignment. Push your project to this repository.

You will need to:
- Add at least 2 more entities with at least `5` attributes each: you should have at least `3` entities in total, let's call them `E1`, `E2`, `E3`.
- Add a **1 to many** relation between two of your entities. Some of the entities can be unrelated, but be prepared to also add a many to many relation soon. Choose your entities accordingly.
- Add storage to a database if you don't already have it: any database type is allowed.
- Implement CRUD for at least one more entity and filtering on a numeric field for at least one entity. The filtering should return all entities with the numeric field higher than a given value.
- Have a REST API usable in Postman.

Sneak peak into what you'll be asked to do in the next assignments:
- Make a free tier account on https://aws.amazon.com/free/ and deploy your app there.
- Add unit tests.
- Add a many to many relation.
- Use a proper database: no SQLite, no SQL Compact, must be Postgres, MS SQL, MySQL, MongoDB etc.
